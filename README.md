# FriendFinder

Our original assignment was to create a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results a users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I have modified mine to help you search for a spirit animal. Because spirit animals are probably more fun than dating sites, I imagine, but can't say for sure.
